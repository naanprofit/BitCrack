# BitCrack

A tool for brute-forcing Bitcoin private keys. The main purpose of this project is to contribute to the effort of solving the [Bitcoin puzzle transaction](https://blockchain.info/tx/08389f34c98c606322740c0be6a7125d9860bb8d5cb182c02f98461e5fa6cd15): A transaction with 32 addresses that become increasingly difficult to crack.


### Using BitCrack

#### Usage


Use `cuBitCrack.exe` for CUDA devices and `clBitCrack.exe` for OpenCL devices.

### Note: **clBitCrack.exe is still EXPERIMENTAL**, as users have reported critial bugs when running on some AMD and Intel devices.

**Note for Intel users:**

There is bug in Intel's OpenCL implementation which affects BitCrack. Details here: https://github.com/brichard19/BitCrack/issues/123


```
xxBitCrack.exe [OPTIONS] [TARGETS]

Where [TARGETS] are one or more Bitcoin address

Options:

-i, --in FILE
    Read addresses from FILE, one address per line. If FILE is "-" then stdin is read

-o, --out FILE
    Append private keys to FILE, one per line

-d, --device N
    Use device with ID equal to N

-b, --blocks BLOCKS
    The number of CUDA blocks

-t, --threads THREADS
    Threads per block

-p, --points NUMBER
    Each thread will process NUMBER keys at a time

--keyspace KEYSPACE
    Specify the range of keys to search, where KEYSPACE is in the format,

	START:END start at key START, end at key END
	START:+COUNT start at key START and end at key START + COUNT
    :END start at key 1 and end at key END
	:+COUNT start at key 1 and end at key 1 + COUNT

-c, --compressed
    Search for compressed keys (default). Can be used with -u to also search uncompressed keys

-u, --uncompressed
    Search for uncompressed keys, can be used with -c to search compressed keys

--compression MODE
    Specify the compression mode, where MODE is 'compressed' or 'uncompressed' or 'both'

--list-devices
    List available devices

--stride NUMBER
    Increment by NUMBER

--share M/N
    Divide the keyspace into N equal sized shares, process the Mth share

--continue FILE
    Save/load progress from FILE
```

#### Examples

The simplest usage, the keyspace will begin at 0, and the CUDA parameters will be chosen automatically
```
xxBitCrack.exe 1FshYsUh3mqgsG29XpZ23eLjWV8Ur3VwH
```

Multiple keys can be searched at once with minimal impact to performance. Provide the keys on the command line, or in a file with one address per line
```
xxBitCrack.exe 1FshYsUh3mqgsG29XpZ23eLjWV8Ur3VwH 15JhYXn6Mx3oF4Y7PcTAv2wVVAuCFFQNiP 19EEC52krRUK1RkUAEZmQdjTyHT7Gp1TYT
```

To start the search at a specific private key, use the `--keyspace` option:

```
xxBitCrack.exe --keyspace 766519C977831678F0000000000 1FshYsUh3mqgsG29XpZ23eLjWV8Ur3VwH
```

The `--keyspace` option can also be used to search a specific range:

```
xxBitCrack.exe --keyspace 80000000:ffffffff 1FshYsUh3mqgsG29XpZ23eLjWV8Ur3VwH
```

To periodically save progress, the `--continue` option can be used. This is useful for recovering
after an unexpected interruption:

```
xxBitCrack.exe --keyspace 80000000:ffffffff 1FshYsUh3mqgsG29XpZ23eLjWV8Ur3VwH
...
GeForce GT 640   224/1024MB | 1 target 10.33 MKey/s (1,244,659,712 total) [00:01:58]
^C
xxBitCrack.exe --keyspace 80000000:ffffffff 1FshYsUh3mqgsG29XpZ23eLjWV8Ur3VwH
...
GeForce GT 640   224/1024MB | 1 target 10.33 MKey/s (1,357,905,920 total) [00:02:12]
```


Use the `-b,` `-t` and `-p` options to specify the number of blocks, threads per block, and keys per thread.
```
xxBitCrack.exe -b 32 -t 256 -p 16 1FshYsUh3mqgsG29XpZ23eLjWV8Ur3VwH
```

#### Pollard Rho/CRT

BitCrack includes an experimental Pollard Rho implementation that collects
bit windows during random walks and reconstructs private keys using the
Chinese Remainder Theorem (CRT).  The CPU-only feature is enabled with the
following options:

```
--pollard              Enable the Pollard Rho/CRT mode
--offsets LIST         Comma-separated bit offsets for CRT windows (required)
--window-size N        Number of bits in each window (default 8)
--tames N              Steps for tame kangaroo walks (0 disables)
--wilds N              Steps for wild kangaroo walks (0 disables)
```

The union of all windows must cover 256 bits for a full reconstruction.
Tame and wild walks run purely on the CPU and are currently best suited for
small demonstrations or research.

Minimal example:

```
xxBitCrack.exe --pollard --offsets 0,64,128,192 --window-size 64 \
              --tames 100000 --wilds 100000 1FshYsUh3mqgsG29XpZ23eLjWV8Ur3VwH
```

### Choosing the right parameters for your device

GPUs have many cores. Work for the cores is divided into blocks. Each block contains threads.

There are 3 parameters that affect performance: blocks, threads per block, and keys per thread.


`blocks:` Should be a multiple of the number of compute units on the device. The default is 32.

`threads:` The number of threads in a block. This must be a multiple of 32. The default is 256.

`Keys per thread:` The number of keys each thread will process. The performance (keys per second)
increases asymptotically with this value. The default is256. Increasing this value will cause the
kernel to run longer, but more keys will be processed.


### Build dependencies

Visual Studio 2019 (if on Windows)

For CUDA: CUDA Toolkit 10.1

For OpenCL: An OpenCL SDK (The CUDA toolkit contains an OpenCL SDK).


### Building in Windows

Open the Visual Studio solution.

Build the `clKeyFinder` project for an OpenCL build.

Build the `cuKeyFinder` project for a CUDA build.

Note: By default the NVIDIA OpenCL headers are used. You can set the header and library path for
OpenCL in the `BitCrack.props` property sheet.

### Building in Linux

Using `make`:

Build CUDA:
```
make BUILD_CUDA=1
```

Build OpenCL:
```
make BUILD_OPENCL=1
```

Or build both:
```
make BUILD_CUDA=1 BUILD_OPENCL=1
```

### Python Pollard Rho/Kangaroo utility

A prototype implementation of a dynamic bit-window Pollard Rho variant with tame and wild kangaroos and a CRT-based reconstruction is available in `tools/pollard_kangaroo_crt.py`.

The script depends on the [`python-ecdsa`](https://pypi.org/project/ecdsa/) package and will optionally use a [`secp256k1`](https://pypi.org/project/secp256k1/) module if present for faster elliptic‑curve operations. If the `secp256k1` module is unavailable, the script automatically falls back to the pure Python backend.

Run the script with `-h` for usage information.
